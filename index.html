            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[14]
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
            Document
            Object Model (DOM).
